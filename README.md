## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- I wouldn't say Mobile-first workflow, but definitely mobile supported
- Bootstrap (minimal)

### What I learned

This might be a bit messy, especially my HTML. Did my best to provide good accessibility. Had fun using Figma for the first time, made things a lot easier, can't wait to see how it comes out. This should be more difficult than my last submission but I found it a lot easier. I guess it's all coming back. Tried adding JS or Bootstrap but the project is too small, and I didn't want to over complicate things.

### Continued development

Figma usage is one I'd like to master. Building responsive websites and improved knowledge of library usage to make things easier.
